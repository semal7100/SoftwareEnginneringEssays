# Cassandra : Overview

Cassandra is a NoSQL distributed database system which can be used to store and retrieve data over thousands of nodes. It was developed by Facebook for its internal inbox search and was based on Google's [BigTable](https://cloud.google.com/bigtable/) and Amazon [Dynamo](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/) . After releasing the source code on Google Code by Facebook it was adopted by Apache which developed it further. Cassandra also supports [Hadoop MapReduce](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r1.2.1/mapred_tutorial.html#Overview) programs making it very useful in distributed computing. It has a special query language developed named as [Cassandra Query Language](https://docs.datastax.com/en/cql/3.1/cql/cql_intro_c.html) (CQL). It supports linear scalability i.e. suppose 10,000 nodes currently process a query in 2 secs then adding more 10,000 clusters will reduce the query time to 1 sec.

Cassandra is a masterless distributed system which can span across multiple data centers. There is no master-slave architecture and nodes are peers. There is no centralized control of any individual or a set of nodes.  That means that every node in the cluster is equally important making it more robust to single point failure. Data is replicated on multiple nodes with a replication factor of n which can be customized. Nodes in every cluster communicate with each other via [Gossip](http://docs.datastax.com/en/archived/cassandra/2.0/cassandra/architecture/architectureGossipAbout_c.html) protocol in which they share status of themselves and other nodes they know about.

Every request can be sent to any node in the cluster. The internal working of Cassandra will make sure that the node with the actual data will process it. Every node in the cluster is logically arranged in a ring shaped topology each given a range of hashes. These hashes range from 0 - (2^127)-1. For query for any row it has a particular primary key which hashes to one of the values in above range. Each node is responsible for a particular range of hashes and hence it will be responsible to primary key which is hashed in its range.

Cassandra is a hybrid of [NoSQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL) and [column oriented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Column-oriented_DBMS) database. This gives it an edge in queries pertaining to a particular column like aggregation or analytical queries. But it also makes it slow in reading and writing entire rows. Hence it is very important to choose it as a database management system if the database is used majorly for OLAP purposes and OLTP purposes.

Databases form a very critical part of any software system. It is usually very hard to change the database once he software is deployed. When developing large scale softwares which handles data of millions of users it very important that the underlying database system which stores, manages and processes the internal database is reliable and fast. Latency in database operations will lead to overall slowdown of the system. Much like software engineering there is no silver bullet when it comes databases. As a software engineer it is very important to make informed decisions when choosing the technology for the underlying architecture. Hence it is important for software engineers to understand the underlying database system and its strengths and limitation to choose a database management system which suits the individual software requirements.
