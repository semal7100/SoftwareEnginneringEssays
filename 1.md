# Overview of Selenium Framework

Selenium is a portable software-testing framework for web applications.Selenium provides a playback (formerly also recording) tool for authoring tests without the need to learn a test scripting language (Selenium IDE). It also provides a test domain-specific language (Selenese) to write tests in a number of popular programming languages, including C#, Groovy, Java, Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby and Scala.


Primarily, it is for automating web applications for testing purposes, but is certainly not limited to just that. Boring web-based administration tasks can (and should!) be automated as well.
Selenium has the support of some of the largest browser vendors who have taken (or are taking) steps to make Selenium a native part of their browser. It is also the core technology in countless other browser automation tools, APIs and frameworks.

## History

Selenium was originally developed by Jason Huggins in 2004 as an internal tool at ThoughtWorks. Huggins was later joined by other programmers and testers at ThoughtWorks, before Paul Hammant joined the team and steered the development of the second mode of operation that would later become "Selenium Remote Control" (RC). The tool was open sourced that year.

Cassandra is a hybrid of [NoSQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL) and [column oriented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Column-oriented_DBMS) database. This gives it an edge in queries pertaining to a particular column like aggregation or analytical queries. But it also makes it slow in reading and writing entire rows. Hence it is very important to choose it as a database management system if the database is used majorly for OLAP purposes and OLTP purposes.

Databases form a very critical part of any software system. It is usually very hard to change the database once he software is deployed. When developing large scale softwares which handles data of millions of users it very important that the underlying database system which stores, manages and processes the internal database is reliable and fast. Latency in database operations will lead to overall slowdown of the system. Much like software engineering there is no silver bullet when it comes databases. As a software engineer it is very important to make informed decisions when choosing the technology for the underlying architecture. Hence it is important for software engineers to understand the underlying database system and its strengths and limitation to choose a database management system which suits the individual software requirements.
