# Overview of Selenium Framework

## Introduction

In an era of highly interactive and responsive software processes where many organizations are using some form of Agile methodology, test automation is frequently becoming a requirement for software projects to make sure that the software can compete with other software processes in the market.Test automation means using a software tool to run repeatable tests against the application to be tested.


Selenium is a software-testing framework for web applications.Selenium provides a tool for authoring tests without the need to learn a test scripting language  with the help of Selenium IDE. One can also make use of Selenese to write tests in a number of programming languages that we make use of in our daily life such as C#,Java, PHP, Python or Scala. Selenium can be thought of as a set of different software tools each with a different approach to support test automation.


Even though the basic functionality of Selenium is to test , but it can still perform many different tasks.It can be used to automate boring web based administration tasks. Selenium is  the core technology in many browser automation tools, APIs and frameworks.


## History

Selenium was originally developed by Jason Huggins in 2004 when he was testing an internal application at ThoughtWorks.He developed a Javascript library that could drive interactions with the page, allowing him to automatically rerun tests against multiple browsers. That library eventually became Selenium Core, which underlies all the functionality of Selenium Remote Control (RC) and Selenium IDE. Selenium RC was ground-breaking because no other product allowed you to control a browser from a language of your choice

## Components
Selenium is composed of several components with each taking on a specific role in aiding the development of web application test automation:<br>



* **Selenium IDE:** 
Selenium IDE is a complete integrated development environment (IDE) for Selenium tests. It is implemented as a Firefox Add-On, and allows recording, editing, and debugging tests. It was previously known as Selenium Recorder. 


* **Selenium Remote Control:** Selenium Remote Control (RC) is a server, written in Java, that accepts commands for the browser via HTTP. RC makes it possible to write automated tests for a web application in any programming language, which allows for better integration of Selenium in existing unit test frameworks. To make writing tests easier, Selenium project currently provides client drivers for PHP, Python, Ruby, .NET, Perl and Java. The Java driver can also be used with JavaScript using the Rhino engine. An instance of selenium RC server is needed to launch html test case - which means that the port should be different for each parallel run.



* **Selenium WebDriver:** Selenium WebDriver is the successor to Selenium RC. Selenium WebDriver accepts commands (sent in Selenese, or via a Client API) and sends them to a browser. This is implemented through a browser-specific browser driver, which sends commands to a browser, and retrieves results. Most browser drivers actually launch and access a browser application (such as Firefox, Chrome, Internet Explorer, or Microsoft Edge); there is also an HtmlUnit browser driver, which simulates a browser using HtmlUnit.


* **Selenium Grid:** Selenium Grid is a server that allows tests to use web browser instances running on remote machines. With Selenium Grid, one server acts as the hub. Tests contact the hub to obtain access to browser instances. The hub has a list of servers that provide access to browser instances (WebDriver nodes), and lets tests use these instances. Selenium Grid allows running tests in parallel on multiple machines, and to manage different browser versions and browser configurations centrally (instead of in each individual test).
