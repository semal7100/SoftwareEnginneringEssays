# Overview of Selenium Framework

## Introduction

In an era of highly interactive and responsive software processes where many organizations are using some form of Agile methodology, test automation is frequently becoming a requirement for software projects to make sure that the software can compete with other software processes in the market.Test automation means using a software tool to run repeatable tests against the application to be tested.


Selenium is a software-testing framework for web applications.Selenium provides a tool for authoring tests without the need to learn a test scripting language  with the help of Selenium IDE. One can also make use of Selenese to write tests in a number of programming languages that we make use of in our daily life such as C#,Java, PHP, Python or Scala. Selenium can be thought of as a set of different software tools each with a different approach to support test automation.


Even though the basic functionality of Selenium is to test , but it can still perform many different tasks.It can be used to automate boring web based administration tasks. Selenium is  the core technology in many browser automation tools, APIs and frameworks.


## History

Selenium was originally developed by Jason Huggins in 2004 as an internal tool at ThoughtWorks. Huggins was later joined by other programmers and testers at ThoughtWorks, before Paul Hammant joined the team and steered the development of the second mode of operation that would later become "Selenium Remote Control" (RC). The tool was open sourced that year.
